            Individuals have grown overly reliant on different technologies 
            and technology, which has resulted in a lack of physical exercise 
            and has tempted people to live an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.
            Human interaction is required for technology to function.Social isolation 
            has increased as a result of computers and cellphones. Young children are 
            spending more time online, playing video games, and disregarding their 
            actual lives. Technology use is also causing job losses and preventing 
            kids from learning.Technology dependence is also raising privacy problems 
            and cybercrime, giving rise to hackers.Despite of various advantages, 
            there are also many disadvantages of technology.s
